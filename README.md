# Score-of-a-String-LeetCode

You are given a string s. The score of a string is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the ASCII values of adjacent characters. Return the score of s.

Example 1:

Input: s = "hello"

Output: 13

Explanation:

The ASCII values of the characters in s are: 'h' = 104, 'e' = 101, 'l' = 108, 'o' = 111. So, the score of s would be |104 - 101| + |101 - 108| + |108 - 108| + |108 - 111| = 3 + 7 + 0 + 3 = 13.
